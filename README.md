# NoSql-social_media_api_Shaw


This application uses express and Mongoose in a MongoDB database. There are two models, users and thoughts. The users would sign up and then would be able to post their thoughts in text. Then, users would be able to befriend one another. That is by using the FriendCount virtual in the User model. Also we used Mongoose subdocuments to create a way to comment "reactions" to the thought posts. The Reactions subdocument is another schema inside of the Thought model.
